        This site chronicles an almost unlikely journey I undertook around mid-2016. That time, I started developing an intensive interest in computer programming. By then I had been using computer over two and half decades. In the past, especially in the late 1990s, I thought I was going to learn website building, but it did not happenbundleRenderer.renderToStream

        In late 1999, I went to Delhi to work on building a website for an international social network. But my first encounter with the guy who was supposed to train me in website building did not go well. I tried to tinker with microsoft's Front Page software but I had absolutely no idea about how to take the website I was writing on Frontpage into the servers. Things took their own turn after that. I lost interest and instead edited a magazine for a year.
